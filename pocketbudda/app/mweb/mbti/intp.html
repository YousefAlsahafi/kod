<h3>INTP</h3>

http://typelogic.com/intp.html

<br/><br/>

INTPs are pensive, analytical folks. They may venture so deeply into thought as
to seem detached, and often actually are oblivious to the world around them. 

<br/><br/>

Precise about their descriptions, INTPs will often correct others (or be sorely
tempted to) if the shade of meaning is a bit off. While annoying to the less
concise, this fine discrimination ability gives INTPs so inclined a natural
advantage as, for example, grammarians and linguists.

<br/><br/>

INTPs are relatively easy-going and amenable to almost anything until their
principles are violated, about which they may become outspoken and
inflexible. They prefer to return, however, to a reserved albeit benign
ambiance, not wishing to make spectacles of themselves.

<br/><br/>

A major concern for INTPs is the haunting sense of impending failure. They spend
considerable time second-guessing themselves. The open-endedness (from
Perceiving) conjoined with the need for competence (NT) is expressed in a sense
that one's conclusion may well be met by an equally plausible alternative
solution, and that, after all, one may very well have overlooked some critical
bit of data. An INTP arguing a point may very well be trying to convince himself
as much as his opposition. In this way INTPs are markedly different from INTJs,
who are much more confident in their competence and willing to act on their
convictions.

<br/><br/>

Mathematics is a system where many INTPs love to play, similarly languages,
computer systems--potentially any complex system. INTPs thrive on
systems. Understanding, exploring, mastering, and manipulating systems can
overtake the INTP's conscious thought. This fascination for logical wholes and
their inner workings is often expressed in a detachment from the environment, a
concentration where time is forgotten and extraneous stimuli are held at
bay. Accomplishing a task or goal with this knowledge is secondary.

<br/><br/>

INTPs and Logic -- One of the tipoffs that a person is an INTP is her obsession
with logical correctness. Errors are not often due to poor logic -- apparent
faux pas in reasoning are usually a result of overlooking details or of
incorrect context.

<br/><br/>

Games NTs seem to especially enjoy include Risk, Bridge, Stratego, Chess, Go,
and word games of all sorts. (I have an ENTP friend that loves Boggle and its
variations. We've been known to sit in public places and pick a word off a menu
or mayonnaise jar to see who can make the most words from its letters on a
napkin in two minutes.) The INTP mailing list has enjoyed a round of Metaphore,
virtual volleyball, and a few 'finish the series' brain teasers.

<br/><br/>

Introverted Thinking

<br/><br/>

Introverted Thinking strives to extract the essence of the Idea from various
externals that express it. In the extreme, this conceptual essence wants no form
or substance to verify its reality. Knowing the Truth is enough for INTPs; the
knowledge that this truth can (or could) be demonstrated is sufficient to
satisfy the knower. "Cogito, ergo sum" expresses this prime directive quite
succinctly.

<br/><br/>

In seasons of low energy level, or moments of single-minded concentration, the
INTP is aloof and detached in a way that might even offend more relational or
extraverted individuals.

<br/><br/>

Extraverted iNtuition

<br/><br/>

Intuition softens and socializes Thinking, fleshing out the brittle bones of
truths formed in the dominant inner world. That which is is not negotiable; yet
actual application diffuses knowledge to the extent that knowledge needs
qualification and context to be of any consequence in this foreign world of
substance.

<br/><br/>

If Thinking can desist, the INTP is free to brainstorm, calling up the
perceptions of the unconscious (i.e., intuition) which are mirrored in patterns
in the realm of matter, time and space. These perceptions, in the form of
theories or hunches, must ultimately defer to the inner principles, or at least
they must not negate them.

<br/><br/>

Intuition unchained gives birth to play. INTPs enjoy games, formal or impromptu,
which coax analogies, patterns and theories from the unseen into spontaneous
expression in a way that defies their own comprehension.

<br/><br/>

Introverted Sensing

<br/><br/>

Sensing is of a subjective, inner nature similar to that of the SJs. It supplies
awareness of the forms of senses rather than the raw, analogic stimuli. Facts
and figures seek to be cleaned up for comparison with an ever growing range of
previously experienced input. Sensing assists intuition in sorting out and
arranging information into the building blocks for Thinking's elaborate systems.

<br/><br/>

The internalizing nature of the INTP's Sensing function leaves a relative
absence of environmental awareness (i.e., Extraverted Sensing), except when the
environment is the current focus. Consciousness of such conditions is at best a
sometime thing.

<br/><br/>

Extraverted Feeling

<br/><br/>

Feeling tends to be all or none. When present, the INTP's concern for others is
intense, albeit naive. In a crisis, this feeling judgement is often silenced by
the emergence of Thinking, who rushes in to avert chaos and destruction. In the
absence of a clear principle, however, INTPs have been known to defer judgement
and to allow decisions about interpersonal matters to be left hanging lest
someone be offended or somehow injured. INTPs are at risk of being swept away by
the shadow in the form of their own strong emotional impulses.

<br/><br/>

As an INTP, your primary mode of living is focused internally, where you deal
with things rationally and logically. Your secondary mode is external, where you
take things in primarily via your intuition.

<br/><br/>

INTPs live in the world of theoretical possibilities. They see everything in
terms of how it could be improved, or what it could be turned into. They live
primarily inside their own minds, having the ability to analyze difficult
problems, identify patterns, and come up with logical explanations. They seek
clarity in everything, and are therefore driven to build knowledge. They are the
"absent-minded professors", who highly value intelligence and the ability to
apply logic to theories to find solutions. They typically are so strongly driven
to turn problems into logical explanations, that they live much of their lives
within their own heads, and may not place as much importance or value on the
external world. Their natural drive to turn theories into concrete understanding
may turn into a feeling of personal responsibility to solve theoretical
problems, and help society move towards a higher understanding.

INTPs value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to
generate new theories, or to prove or disprove existing theories. They approach
problems and theories with enthusiasm and skepticism, ignoring existing rules
and opinions and defining their own approach to the resolution. They seek
patterns and logical explanations for anything that interests them. They're
usually extremely bright, and able to be objectively critical in their
analysis. They love new ideas, and become very excited over abstractions and
theories. They love to discuss these concepts with others. They may seem
"dreamy" and distant to others, because they spend a lot of time inside their
minds musing over theories. They hate to work on routine things - they would
much prefer to build complex theoretical solutions, and leave the implementation
of the system to others. They are intensely interested in theory, and will put
forth tremendous amounts of time and energy into finding a solution to a problem
with has piqued their interest.

<br/><br/>

INTPs do not like to lead or control people. They're very tolerant and flexible
in most situations, unless one of their firmly held beliefs has been violated or
challenged, in which case they may take a very rigid stance. The INTP is likely
to be very shy when it comes to meeting new people. On the other hand, the INTP
is very self-confident and gregarious around people they know well, or when
discussing theories which they fully understand.

<br/><br/>

The INTP has no understanding or value for decisions made on the basis of
personal subjectivity or feelings. They strive constantly to achieve logical
conclusions to problems, and don't understand the importance or relevance of
applying subjective emotional considerations to decisions. For this reason,
INTPs are usually not in-tune with how people are feeling, and are not naturally
well-equiped to meet the emotional needs of others.

<br/><br/>

The INTP may have a problem with self-aggrandizement and social rebellion, which
will interfere with their creative potential. Since their Feeling side is their
least developed trait, the INTP may have difficulty giving the warmth and
support that is sometimes necessary in intimate relationships. If the INTP
doesn't realize the value of attending to other people's feelings, he or she may
become overly critical and sarcastic with others. If the INTP is not able to
find a place for themself which supports the use of their strongest abilities,
they may become generally negative and cynical. If the INTP has not developed
their Sensing side sufficiently, they may become unaware of their environment,
and exhibit weakness in performing maintenance-type tasks, such as bill-paying
and dressing appropriately.

<br/><br/>

For the INTP, it is extremely important that ideas and facts are expressed
correctly and succinctly. They are likely to express themselves in what they
believe to be absolute truths. Sometimes, their well thought-out understanding
of an idea is not easily understandable by others, but the INTP is not naturally
likely to tailor the truth so as to explain it in an understandable way to
others. The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it
out, moving on to the next thing. It's important that the INTP place importance
on expressing their developed theories in understandable ways. In the end, an
amazing discovery means nothing if you are the only person who understands it.

<br/><br/>

The INTP is usually very independent, unconventional, and original. They are not
likely to place much value on traditional goals such as popularity and
security. They usually have complex characters, and may tend to be restless and
temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought
patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways. Consequently, a lot of
scientific breakthroughs in the world have been made by the INTP.

<br/><br/>

The INTP is at his best when he can work on his theories independently. When
given an environment which supports his creative genius and possible
eccentricity, the INTP can accomplish truly remarkable things. These are the
pioneers of new thoughts in our society.

Jungian functional preference ordering:

<br/><br/>

Dominant: Introverted Thinking
<br/><br/>

Auxiliary: Extraverted Intuition
<br/><br/>

Tertiary: Introverted Sensing
<br/><br/>

Inferior: Extraverted Feeling

<br/><br/>

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTP

<br/><br/>

Keirsey referred to INTPs as Architects, one of the four types belonging to the
temperament he called the Rationals. INTPs are one of the rarest types,
accounting for about 1-5% of the population.

<br/><br/>

I - Introversion preferred to extraversion: INTPs tend to be quiet and
reserved. They generally prefer interacting with a few close friends rather than
a wide circle of acquaintances, and they expend energy in social situations
(whereas extraverts gain energy).
      
<br/><br/>

N - iNtuition preferred to sensing: INTPs tend to be more abstract than
concrete. They focus their attention on the big picture rather than the details,
and on future possibilities rather than immediate realities.[8]
      
<br/><br/>

T - Thinking preferred to feeling: INTPs tend to value objective criteria
above personal preference. When making decisions, they generally give more
weight to logic than to social considerations.[9]
      
<br/><br/>

P - Perception preferred to judgment: INTPs tend to withhold judgment and
delay important decisions, preferring to "keep their options open" should
circumstances change.[10]
      

<br/><br/>

INTPs are quiet, thoughtful, analytical individuals who tend to spend long
periods of time on their own, working through problems and forming
solutions. They are curious about systems and how things work. Consequently,
they are frequently found in careers such as science, architecture, and
law. INTPs tend to be less at ease in social situations or in the "caring
professions," although they enjoy the company of those who share their
interests. They prize autonomy in themselves and others. They generally balk at
attempts by others to convince them to change. They also tend to be impatient
with the bureaucracy, rigid hierarchies, and the politics prevalent in many
professions. INTPs have little regard for titles and badges, which they often
consider to be unjustified. INTPs usually come to distrust authority as
hindering the uptake of novel ideas and the search for knowledge. INTPs accept
ideas based on merit, rather than tradition or authority. They have little
patience for social customs that seem illogical or that serve as obstacles for
pursuing ideas and knowledge. This may place them at odds with people who have
an SJ preference, since SJs tend to defer to authority, tradition, and what the
rest of the group is doing.[2] INTPs prefer to work informally with others as
equals.[11] 

<br/><br/>

INTPs organize their understanding of any topic by articulating principles, and
they are especially drawn to theoretical constructs. Having articulated these
principles for themselves, they can demonstrate remarkable skill in explaining
complex ideas to others in simple terms, especially in writing. On the other
hand, their ability to grasp complexity may also lead them to provide overly
detailed explanations of simple ideas, and listeners may judge that the INTP
makes things more difficult than they need to be. To the INTPs' mind, they are
presenting all the relevant information or trying to crystallize the concept as
clearly as possible.[11] 

<br/><br/>

Given their independent nature, INTPs may prefer working alone to leading or
following in a group. During interactions with others, if INTPs are focused on
gathering information, they may seem oblivious, aloof, or even rebellious-when
in fact they are concentrating on listening and understanding. However, INTPs'
extraverted intuition often gives them a quick wit, especially with
language. They may defuse tension through comical observations and
references. They can be charming, even in their quiet reserve, and are sometimes
surprised by the high esteem in which their friends and colleagues hold
them.[11]

<br/><br/>

INTPs are driven to fully understand a discussion from all relevant
angles. Their impatience with seemingly indefensible ideas can make them
particularly devastating at debate.[2] When INTPs feel insulted, they may
respond with sudden, cutting criticism. After such an incident, INTPs are likely
to be as bewildered as the recipient. They have broken the rules of debate and
exposed their raw emotions. To INTPs, this is the crux of the problem:
improperly handled emotions, INTPs believe, can only harm. While INTPs
experience emotions as an important part of their internal lives, and sometimes
share their emotions with others, INTPs nevertheless believe that emotions must
not play a role in logical discussions, or be expressed in a way that would put
themselves at disadvantage.

<br/><br/>

Dominant: Introverted thinking (Ti)

<br/><br/>

Ti seeks precision, such as the exact word to express an idea. It notices the
minute distinctions that define the essence of things, then analyzes and
classifies them. Ti examines all sides of an issue, looking to solve problems
while minimizing effort and risk. It uses models to root out logical
inconsistency.[12] Ti is calm, articulate, and aware of the forces that bind
reality together. As introverted Thinkers, INTPs spend the majority of their
time and energy ordering the interior, logical world of principles and
generalizations in an effort to understand.  [edit] Auxiliary: Extraverted
intuition (Ne)

<br/><br/>

Ne finds and interprets hidden meanings, using -Y´what if¡ questions to
explore alternatives, allowing multiple possibilities to coexist. This
imaginative play weaves together insights and experiences from various sources
to form a new whole, which can then become a catalyst to action.[13] Ne gives
INTPs a grasp of the patterns of the world around them. They use their intuition
to amalgamate empirical data into coherent pictures, from which they can derive
universal principles. INTPs frequently puzzle over a problem for hours on end,
until the answer suddenly crystallizes in a flash of insight.  [edit] Tertiary:
Introverted sensing (Si)

<br/><br/>

Si collects data in the present moment and compares it with past experiences, a
process that sometimes evokes the feelings associated with memory, as if the
subject were reliving it. Seeking to protect what is familiar, Si draws upon
history to form goals and expectations about what will happen in the future.[14]
Si gives INTPs the potential for keen observation. They use this function to
gather empirical data, use physical tools, perceive physical relationships, and
support their internal logic with a rich sense of space.  [edit] Inferior:
Extraverted feeling (Fe)

<br/><br/>

Fe seeks social connections and creates harmonious interactions through polite,
considerate, and appropriate behavior. Fe responds to the explicit (and
implicit) wants of others, and may even create an internal conflict between the
subject’s own needs and the desire to meet the needs of others.[15] Fe drives
the INTP to desire harmony in community. At their most relaxed, INTPs can be
charming and outgoing among friends, or when they have a clearly defined role in
the group. When under stress, however, INTPs can feel disconnected from the
people around them, unable to use their extraverted Feeling to reach out to
others. As their inferior function, Feeling can be a weak point; when threatened
they will hide behind a wall of stoic logic. This can lead them to bottle up
their emotions to preserve reason and harmony; but a failure to deal with these
concealed emotions can lead to inappropriate outbursts.

<br/><br/>

      
Type dynamics of the INTP    

<br/><br/>

As a practical example of Type Dynamics, consider the two types known as the
introverted thinkers (ISTP and INTP). They share dominant introverted thinking,
which gives them a solid interior grasp of underlying principles. The ISTPs,
with their preference for extraverted sensing, love understanding physical,
mechanical systems. The INTPs, with their extraverted intuition, love
understanding theoretical systems. ISTPs are often quite skilled in using
whatever materials are at hand in their building projects, using available tools
to their full capabilities to serve their goals, through their extraverted
sensing. INTPs, like their Sensing cousins, love using the right tool for the
right job, but they also consult their intuition to solve problems. They are
particularly comfortable with "virtual" tools, reflecting their love of
technology.[citation needed]

<br/><br/>

With a knack for improvisation, the INTP can cause no end of frustration to
ESTJs and ISTJs. These types generally cannot make the same intuitive leaps that
come naturally to the INTP. On the other hand, they are quick to note (sometimes
smugly) when the INTP must stop in the middle of a project to puzzle over the
previously discarded instructions, which the STJs read at the start.[11]


<br/><br/>

http://www.teamtechnology.co.uk/myers-briggs/intp.htm


<br/><br/>

INTPs direct their energy towards the inner world of thoughts and emotions. They structure and organise their ideas, coming up with theories and explanations to explain new areas of scientific research or experience. They often seek to understand the full complexity of any situation and enjoy solving difficult intellectual problems.
What makes an INTP tick?

<br/><br/>

The Dominant function is the judging one of Thinking. Characteristics associated with this function include:

<br/><br/>

* Likes making decisions on the basis of logic, using objective considerations
<br/>
* Is concerned with truth, principles and justice
<br/>
* Is analytical and critical, tending to see the flaws in situations
<br/>
* Takes an objective approach 
<br/>
<br/>

The judging Thinking function is introverted. That is, Thinking is used
primarily to govern the inner world of thoughts and emotions. The INTP will
therefore:

<br/><br/>

* spend time thinking analytically, organising thoughts on a logical basis
<br/>
* develop an understanding of the principles involved in a situation
<br/>
* spontaneously feel critical of a person or situation, but not necessarily express that criticism
<br/>
* be inwardly decisive, but not communicate those decisions to others
<br/>
* think mostly about impersonal issues, focusing more on concepts, truths and systems rather than individuals' feelings 

<br/><br/>

The Thinking function is primarily supported by extraverted iNtuitive perception. That is, iNtuitive perception is used primarily to manage the outer world of actions and spoken words. This will modify the way that the Thinking is directed, by:

<br/><br/>

* focusing the (inner world) Thinking on understanding possibilities for the future
<br/>
* perceiving patterns in information to support the logical analysis 

<br/><br/>

The classic temperament of an INTP is Promethean, or Phlegmatic, for whom a basic driving force is the search for competence or excellence.
Contributions to the team of an INTP

<br/><br/>

In a team environment, the INTP can contribute by:

<br/>
<br/>

* using analytical and critical skills to solve problems
<br/>
* focusing attention on the central issue
<br/>
* providing intellectual insight
<br/>
* suggesting ideas that achieve long and short term aims
<br/>
* viewing information objectively 
<br/>

The potential ways in which an INTP can irritate others include:

* being too intellectual
<br/>
* finding too many flaws, and not accepting imperfect but 'good enough' solutions
<br/>
* not taking account of others' feelings
<br/>
* suggesting ideas and then appearing to change his/her mind
<br/>
* leave others to worry about implementation once the major problems have been solved
<br/>
* clinging to a principle at the expense of relationships and harmony 

<br/>
<br/>

Personal Growth
<br/>
<br/>

As with all types, the INTP can achieve personal growth by developing all functions that are not fully developed, through actions such as:

<br/>
<br/>
* expressing appreciation towards others
<br/>
* working within other people's limitations
<br/>
* accepting and praising others' imperfect efforts, if they are 'good enough'
<br/>
* consulting others more, and involving them in decisions, to engender ownership
of the solution
<br/>
* spending time to develop personal relationships for their own sake
<br/>
* learning to acknowledge and develop the INTP's own emotions and personal values 

<br/>
<br/>
Recognising Stress

<br/>
<br/>
As stress increases, 'learned behaviour' tends to give way to the natural style,
so the INTP will behave more according to type when under greater stress. For
example, in a crisis, the INTP might:

<br/>
<br/>
* withdraw to think about the central issue that needs attention
<br/>
* suggest various ideas, and use the feedback received to support the
intellectual analysis
<br/>
* debate the issue from an intellectual point of view, and leave it very late
before making a decision
<br/>
* criticise others efforts and ignore their feelings 
<br/>
<br/>
Under extreme stress, fatigue or illness, the INTP's shadow may appear - a
negative form of ESFJ. Example characteristics are:
<br/>
<br/>
* expressing intense negative emotions towards others
<br/>
* being very sensitive to criticism
<br/>
* becoming preoccupied with details, without any logical basis
<br/>
* interpreting facts or events in a very subjective way 

<br/>
<br/>
The shadow is part of the unconscious that is often visible to others, onto whom
the shadow is projected. The INTP may therefore readily see these faults in
others without recognising it in him/her self.

<br/>
<br/>

From Minh Tan Compilation

<br/>
<br/>

The Architect prides themselves on their objectivity and ability to impartially
analyze and organize thoughts. They enjoy tough critiques that help them to hone
the exactitude of their thoughts. What they don’t like is strong emotional
expression directed at them and being denied the alone time that they need. If
this goes on too long, they become highly stressed and may emphasize their
logical thinking to the extreme. They become overly sensitive to relationships
with others and can lash out emotionally. To achieve their normal state again,
they need to be left alone and not asked about their feelings. They also need
reduced responsibilities until they recover.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.personalitypage.com/html/INTP_rel.html

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs live rich worlds inside their minds, which are full of imagination and
excitement. Consequently, they sometimes find the external world pales in
comparison. This may result in a lack of motivation to form and maintain
relationships. INTPs are not likely to have a very large circle of significant
relationships in their lives. They're much more likely to have a few very close
relationships, which they hold in great esteem and with great affection. Since
the INTP's primary focus and attention is turned inwards, aimed towards seeking
clarity from abstract ideas, they are not naturally tuned into others' emotional
feelings and needs. They tend to be difficult to get to know well, and hold back
parts of themselves until the other person has proven themselves "worthy" of
hearing the INTP's thoughts. Holding Knowledge and Brain Power above all else in
importance, the INTP will choose to be around people who they consider to be
intelligent. Once the INTP has committed themself to a relationship, they tend
to be very faithful and loyal, and form affectionate attachments which are pure
and straight-forward. The INTP has no interest or understanding of game-playing
with regards to relationships. However, if something happens which the INTP
considers irreconciliable, they will leave the relationship and not look back.

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs approach their intimate relationships quite seriously - as they approach
most things in life. They take their vows and commitments seriously, and are
usually faithful and loyal. They are usually pretty easy to live with and be
around, because they have simple daily needs and are not overly demanding of
their partners in almost any respect. While the INTP's internal life is highly
theoretical and complex, their external life in comparison is usually quite
simple. They like to keep the complexities of their external world to a minimum,
so that they can focus their brain power on working through their theories
internally. This makes them very straight-forward, honest lovers, with a love
that is quite pure in its simple, uncomplicated nature. 

<br/>
<br/>

Although they choose to keep things straight-forward in their relationships,
this does not mean that the INTP is lacking in depth of feeling or passion. The
INTP is very creative person, who has vivid imaginations. They can be very
excitable and passionate about their love relationships. Sometimes, they have a
problem reconciling the exciting visions of their internal worlds with the
actuality of their external circumstances.

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs do not like to deal with messy complications, such as interpersonal
conflict, and so they may fall into the habit of ignoring conflict when it
occurs. If they feel they must face the conflict, they're likely to approach it
from an analytical perspective. This may aggravate the conflict situation, if
their partner simply wants to feel that they are supported and loved. Most
people (and especially those with the Feeling preference) simply want to be
encouraged, affirmed and supported when they are upset. The INTP should practice
meeting these needs in conflict situations.

<br/>
<br/>

INTP's natural partner is the ENTJ, or the ESTJ. The INTP's dominant function of
Introverted Thinking is best matched with a partner whose personality is
dominated by Extraverted Thinking. The INTP/ENTJ match is ideal, because these
types shared Intuition as a common way of perceiving the world, but INTP/ESTJ is
also a good match.

Designer Theorizer: INTP

<br/>
<br/>

Relationship

<br/>
<br/>

The last minute planner is often found in the INTP. They are in such a
rush to discover and feel everything that they are in a constant state
of planning. The idea of changing on a dime is never a problem for the
INTP. 

<br/>
<br/>

In love relationships, patience is key in dealing with the INTP. They
are always ready to explore the deepest reaches of love and commitment
but can also reverse course with alarming speed. What is often seen,
as a lack of caring is really just the inability to plan. 

<br/>
<br/>

The family is a great tool for the INTP to explore who they are. They
will often do the entire family root discovering in an effort to find
out more information and gain more knowledge about the base of their
family and ultimately themselves. 
Career

<br/>
<br/>

The INTP needs to find a challenge. They love to problem solve. If
they ever find themselves in a situation that doesn't challenge them,
they will grow discontented and depressed. Listlessness is their
greatest pain. Other popular INTP career directions include: Strategic
Planning, Writer, Lawyer, Computer Programmer. 

<br/>
<br/>

Education

<br/>
<br/>

The INTP has many interests and due to this broad range often find
school difficult due to the need for focus. Often where it was tough
to get through grade school, the INTP will thrive in the college
environment.

<br/>
<br/>

http://www.centreforconfidence.co.uk/type-resources.php?pid=377

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are extremely analytical types who are naturally drawn to
solving intellectual problems. They tend to be original thinkers who
develop real expertise in their chosen field. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTPS predominantly use intuition in their external world. This leads
them to be big picture, conceptual thinkers who are drawn to the
abstract and the theoretical. They take great pleasure in discussing
ideas with other people - particularly those who share their
intellectual approach.  
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs' first preference is for thinking which they use to run their
interior thought processes. Their intuition comes up with new
information and then their thinking sets about finding new ways to
analyse it. Unlike some of the other thinking types, INTPs do not use
their thinking to try to control other people or run their outer
life. 

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are able to hold many complex thoughts in their head but they
often find it difficult to do justice to the complexity of this in
speech. When this happens they can feel frustrated. They may then turn
to writing as it offers them a better way to convey the sophistication
of their thoughts.  

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs are very sceptical and take nothing at face value. Indeed they
tend to have a very scientific attitude to life, seeing nothing as the
truth but simply as the best starting point for analysis. They are
often attracted to philosophy, science or social sciences and to
academic life in general.  

INTPs' intellectual and sceptical approach often leads them to be the
most questioning of all the types. They often feel driven to clarify
and detest sloppy thinking or inconsistencies. In discussion this
leads them to readily point out the flaws or illogicalities in others'
thinking. They will often contradict other people or try to engage
them in debate on precise definition of terms and concepts.  

Truth and honesty are vitally important to INTPs and they need to feel
they are acting in congruence with their principles. It is also
difficult for INTPs to respect anyone who they do not perceive as
operating with intellectual or personal integrity. INTPs do not have a
great need to discuss their principles with others. They discuss ideas
readily yet much of their thinking is never conveyed to other people. 
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs value their independence greatly and expect others to
reciprocate. This means that relationships can sometimes be a
difficult area for them to achieve the balance between autonomy and
sharing which they often desire.  
<br/>
<br/>


Despite their natural reticence in relationships INTPs often make
great networkers. They will get to know and maintain relationships
with people who they think are interesting or who may have access to
information which may be useful to them or their colleagues.  
<br/>
<br/>


INTPs sometimes find it difficult to finish things unless they have a
deadline. They like variety and need room for manoeuvre. Like all NPs,
INTPs struggle with organisation and don't often pay enough attention
to practical details. They can find it easy to mislay things and
generally find it hard to keep order and control in their outer
lives. This is in contrast to the structure of the inner world.  

<br/>
<br/>

INTPs, like their fellow type ISTPs, may be prone to outbursts of
anger. Outwardly they may appear laid back people but in their head
their thinking is leading them to make continual evaluations and
judgments. However, as introverts, INTPs don't tend to tell other
people these thoughts until they have stepped over an invisible
line. The INTPs' annoyance then boils over and they get angry. To
other people this seems to happen out of the blue and it can be a
source of friction in their relationships both at work and at home. 

<br/>
<br/>

Relationships with others, particularly paying attention to people's
feelings can be hard for INTPs. Others can resent what they see as
INTPs' desire to split hairs or indulge in intellectual
competition. But INTPs often believe their verbal challenges are a
sincere and genuine attempt to help the person improve their
thinking. 

<br/>
<br/>

Female INTPs often learn to curb these impulses to challenge others'
views, as they are more aware of how it can be damaging to others but
male INTPs can find this a harder lesson to learn. Female INTPS often
learn earlier that relationships are important and need to be
nurtured. 

<br/>
<br/>

Ultimately it is important for INTPs to manage their anger
better. They can do this by learning to be more assertive and
expressing their growing displeasure at an earlier stage.  It is also
helpful for them to begin to pay more attention to the importance of
feelings - their own and others. Time management skills can also prove
useful.

Common relationship Issues for INTPs

<br/>
<br/>
INTPs show caring by listening to others and challenging their
thoughts processes to ensure logic and rationality. 

<br/>
<br/>
INTPs like others to take their ideas seriously and to be prepared to 
debate them at length.

<br/>

<br/>
<br/>

Like prominent scholars and theorists such as Jung and Einstein, you
have the ability to single-mindedly pursue your goals and move around
obstacles while avoiding distractions that would derail most people.
Absorbed by the inner world of thoughts and ideas, you use your
rational ability coolly, objectively and impersonally.  Your family
and friends most likely tend to describe you as creative and ingenious
yet also understated and a bit shy.

<br/>
<br/>

Your greatest personal strength lies in your ability to patiently and
thoroughly work out the fundamental principles of a system, an
operation or a problem.  In fact, you happily tend to lose yourself in
thought.  You do not need encouragement or support from others to
continue your work.  Indeed, it is not essential that others even
understand or appreciate what you do for you to function.  You are an
independent thinker, content in a world unto yourself. 

<br/>
<br/>

Overall the INTPs tend to have very accommodating and flexible
personalities.  Moving from one intuitive understanding to another is
usually effortless for you.  Deep in thought, your first interest is
mostly on solving puzzles.  Before you will communicate and contribute
your thoughts, you want to make sure you have them clearly organised
internally first.  As a result, you can sometimes be seen as reserved
and withdrawn.  In fact, you may even tend to regard others as a
disturbance to your intense thinking process.  That is because your
focus is to pay more attention to the realm of logic and principles
than situations or people. 

<br/>
<br/>

An INTP may also have difficulty communicating ideas effectively.
Conversations can quickly turn into articulating the exactness of the
tiniest pieces of the entire puzzle.  Before you know it, the answer
to a question can be so precise and complicated that few can follow
the discussion.  But an INTP certainly appreciates those who have the
patience and attentiveness to keep up with the dialogue. 

<br/>
<br/>

If you are called upon to share information or instruct others,
however, remember to be organised, keep the ideas simple and use
common language instead of jargon.  As a result, your presentations
and communications will become more successful.  Also, do not hesitate
to ask for feedback from your friends and colleagues, even in casual
conversation, and then use that feedback to enhance your communication
style. 

<br/>
<br/>

Intimate relationships can sometimes pose a dilemma for
Introverting-Thinking types, simply because of the feelings involved.
You do not intend to be coarse or unkind-sometimes you are simply
inattentive to the significance of the Feeling dimension.  So intent
are you on the content of a conversation, that you may not be aware of
another's feelings or how your behaviour affects others.  You might
let feelings affect your own attitudes and behaviour so little that it
may be difficult to convince you about anything except through reason
and logic. 

<br/>
<br/>

On the other hand, you and other INTPs do have feelings and you do
relate to people.  But the Feeling dimension is not your first
preference-Thinking is.  It could take more awareness and practice on
your part to become more aware of the important part your feelings and
those of others play in communication and relationships. 

<br/>
<br/>

Introverts overall tend to invest time, caring and affection in only a
few people, gauging friendships by depth and endurance, rather than by
breadth and quantity.  As an Introvert, carefree external
demonstrations of feeling do not mean that much to you.  "Still waters
run deep" characterises best your view of friendships and
relationships.  As a result, you tend to not need liberal and open
reciprocation of your feelings, nor do you require lots of active
contact to sustain a relationship.  When a friend is in need, you will
be there - this year, next year, ten years from now.  You have the
ability to form a kind of quiet, intense and devoted friendship. 

<br/>
<br/>
Although only a small segment of the population falls into your
personality category, if you only counted the number of faculty
teaching at distinguished colleges and universities, you would think
the world was abundant with INTPs.  Wherever you find an body of
individuals whose distinguishing characteristics are imagination,
originality, perceptive acumen, creativity and a delight in tackling
the complex, you will find a number of kindred souls.  You are perhaps
the most intellectually profound of all the Types.  Thinking, combined
with Intuition, gives you greater insight than Thinking alone and
provides you with intellectual curiosity, speed in understanding,
ingenuity and a wealth of ideas for dealing with problems.  However,
these same qualities also make it more difficult for you to deal with
repetitive tasks or mundane facts and realities.

<br/>
<br/>

Continually living on the edge of logical plausibilities and
potentials, you delight in abstract projects and are excited by the
unknown.  As long as your expansive mind and intellect are not
swallowed up by mind-numbing day-to-day routines, you can succeed in
any occupation.  Internally, you want order, but consistent order
might not be present in your external world.  Instead, you tend to go
through cycles of being organised and then disorganised.   

<br/>
<br/>

Intuitive, Introverted Thinkers like yourself often find themselves caught in the 
"absentminded professor's" syndrome in everyday life.

<br/>
<br/>
You are an individual in love with learning and are fascinated by the
very concept of intelligence.  You, and those like you, share an inner
drive toward performance and a highly self-critical nature that allows
you to continually strive for self-improvement.  Always setting higher
standards, you maintain a "mental list" of things you ought to learn,
accomplish and master. 

<br/>
<br/>

The times when you feel twinges of inadequacy are the times you
measure your worth, and the worth of others, solely by the yardstick
of achievements and accomplishments.  If work is important enough, you
can become a perfectionist and lose sight of when a project is "good
enough."  This is due to your tendency to set your personal standards
so impossibly high.  If you become discouraged or are under a lot of
stress, it is easy for you to make self-judgements and label yourself
as incompetent.  It may be difficult for you to break this cycle of
negative thinking.

<br/>
<br/>

Your Introverted nature seeks peace to work most comfortably.
Whatever the job, you will spend time thinking before acting.  Given
the choice, you prefer a working environment that is quiet and where
you can easily work alone.  You would be content if the telephone
never rang and no one ever intruded or interrupted your train of
thought.

<br/>
<br/>
For you, working long hours on a project without a break is not
bothersome.  You take pride and interest in your job, especially if
you keep in touch with the ideas behind your assignments.  Your
Perceptive qualities allow you to handle great diversity in work and
it is easy for you to shift from one assignment or technique to
another. 

<br/>
<br/>

It is this Perceptive side that allows you to be open and tolerant of
changing situations and tasks requiring repeated revisions.  However,
this open style of working could find you initiating too many
revisions, additions, changes and alterations when they are
unnecessary.  Besides the danger of continually revising or changing
material unasked, there is the twin danger of beginning projects that
you never finish-because they are always changing!  As a result, many
of these activities you have launched wind up in a file, first
delayed, then forgotten. 

<br/>
<br/>

Your Intuiting nature has you continually scanning the horizon for any
future possibilities or potentials within a situation, rather than
staring down at the ground beneath you.  As a result, you can easily
be recognised as an explorer or visionary.  New ideas and theories
fascinate you, and you enthusiastically tackle new problems no matter
how complex.  During these times, you have an unnerving ability to
gather vast stores of patience and energy to devote toward solving the
problem.  However, driven to understand, predict and explain reality,
you may slip into a favourite pattern for those with your personality
- living in a world of ideas, trying to figure out what everything
around you means and, thereby, missing out on directly experiencing
much of life.

<br/>
<br/>

An INTP will find fulfilment when developing ideas, concepts and
principles and typically make great contributions to a chosen field.
You are a person who appreciates intelligence, continually seeks to
increase knowledge and sees possibilities beyond what is present,
known or obvious. 

<br/>
<br/>

It would also be wise, however, to surround yourself with people who
view the world with their Sensing qualities.  Since Sensing types
focus so strongly on the concrete world and direct experience, and
always keep track of the smallest facts and details, you will probably
find their counsel and feedback useful.  Since Intuiting people
usually prefer the company of other Intuitives, you may find this
uncomfortable.  Yet an Intuitive person with a Sensing partner is more
likely to achieve success than the Intuitive alone since their skills
are complimentary. 

<br/>
<br/>

Watch out when circumstances find you working at a job that makes
little use of your Intuiting qualities.  Even worse, avoid occupations
requiring you to only gather, count and manage facts, figures, widgets
or gadgets - activities requiring you to use your lesser developed
Sensing side.  You would be better off turning your sights to tasks
requiring you to view the big picture and bold concepts, not minutia.   

<br/><br/>

If, and when, you find that job, employer, or body of co-workers who
can appreciate your style and qualities, you will be valued for your
creative intellect and the imaginative gems you provide to the world
of everyday work.

<br/><br/>

While sometimes presenting as aloof or self-focused, INTPs often attract potential mates through their Extraverted Intuition (Ne) and Extraverted Feeling (Fe). These functions contribute to their wittiness, personability, and sincerity, conferring a childlike innocence that others find refreshing. INTPs are often kind and considerate, wanting everyone to feel included and treated with respect (Fe). They are slow to speak negatively of others, able to forgive and forget what other types might find offensive. Such qualities, combined with their intelligence and ambitiousness, can be of great appeal to prospective partners.

<br/><br/>

Should INTPs Even Bother with Relationships?

<br/><br/>

Because of their Fe inferior, INTPs can enjoy being around
people. Even if not directly engaging with them, they can feel
enlivened by the background presence of others (assuming they are not
perceived as obnoxious or intrusive). However, because of their
dominant function’s penchant for inner control and autonomy (Ti),
INTPs can be leery of making Fe commitments, which carry the potential
to shackle their independence.

<br/><br/>

INTP RelationshipsThe fact that INTPs can enjoy working independently
for long periods of time may also discourage them from complicating
their lives with relationships. Despite this relative independence,
there invariably comes a time when their inferior function (Fe)
beckons them to be around people. This may involve feelings of
emptiness or loneliness, alerting them to the fact that their
independent projects may, in and of themselves, be insufficient for
achieving the deeper sense of wholeness and contentment they
desire. This tug-of-war between their Ti and Fe is a central and
recurrent dilemma for INTPs. At some level, INTPs feel like they need
people and want an intimate relationship, while on another, they are
afraid of losing themselves and their cherished freedom if they
commit. 

<br/><br/>

In many cases, INTPs’ fears are justified. Most partners are reluctant
to grant them the degree of freedom and autonomy they desire, leading
them to try to control the INTP. This of course, prompts the INTP to
rebel, which causes the relationship to take a turn for the worse. But
because Fe is a legitimate part of INTPs’ functional stack, we should
not be too quick to dismiss the potential value of intimate
relationships for INTPs. As the final function in their stack,
understanding and integrating their Fe is critical to their
self-actualization. With that said, sustainable and satisfying
romantic relationships can be hard to come by for INTPs, requiring
that both they and their partners bring significant wisdom and
maturity to the relationship. For this reason, among others, most
INTPs are better off abstaining from any long-term commitments until
later in their development.
