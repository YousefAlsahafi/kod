INSTALL

o Install Pymacs

o Install JDE

o Based on the emacs-ubuntu.el make your changes to your .emacs. 

o Drop the contents of zip file (or if using git the entire working directory)
  as pyjde directory under your site-lisp directory. Make sure you change some
  hard-code paths to point to this directory.
  
o You can use testmyclass.py for testing purposes. python testmyclass.py.

o It is assumed your Java project has prj.el file with sourcepath and lib path
  defined in it. Look under test directory for an example.

DESIGN

A *PyJde* buffer is the communication window to/fro the user. All output will be
listed here. 
  
CURRENT STATE

Our menu has

   ["PyJde Find Descendants..." pyjde-do-find-descendants]
   ["PyJde Visit Class..." pyjde-do-find-file-at-symbol]
   ["PyJde Goto Definition..." pyjde-do-goto-definition]
   ["PyJde List Methods..." pyjde-do-find-public-methods]
   ["PyJde List Imports..." pyjde-do-find-imports]
   ["PyJde Pick Method..." pyjde-do-pick-method]
   ["PyJde Pick Import..." pyjde-do-pick-import]
   
For intellisense, after "." type \C p p to list methods, and \C p m to pick a
method. If you would like Emacs to guide you to each param entry by highlighing
them, press M-# M-#. It will send you to first param, you enter this, then M-#
M-# takes you to next one, so on.

DECOMPILE NEW JARS

In order to get java files from jar files, you need to include 

  <target name="unjar">
    <exec executable="python">
      <arg line="/usr/share/emacs/22.2/site-lisp/pyjde/unjar.py"/>
      <arg line="[TOP OF YOUR SOURCE TREE]"/>
    </exec>
  </target>

to your build.xml and call this target whenever you have a new jar in your
prj.el.
  

FUTURE

Call trees (per class, per method), 

ISSUES

o Decompiling rt.jar from JAVA_HOME does not work (at least for Java 6); If you
  want to get source code browsing, method completion for java.util, java.lang
  classes, I suggest you download JDK SE 6 sources from Sun and simply copy them
  under ~/.pyjde/yourproject/rt.jar/. Pyjde will pick up classes from here. You
  don't have to change your prj.el for this.
