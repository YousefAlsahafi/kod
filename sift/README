Run make under siftpp, then make.sh under siftpy. After this you will
have a siftpy.so under this directory. Then you can run the test3.py
code. The scale parameter siftpy.c must match the scale parameter in
test3.py.  It's a little hacky - for now. For the most basic example
creating img3.key, you need

int _width=800;
int _height=640;

in siftpy.c.
