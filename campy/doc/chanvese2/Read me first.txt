This code package is composed of two parts: the cell segmentation and cell tracking.

1. Cell Segmentation based on Chan-Vese Level Set Method, including files:
levelsetsegmentation.m
Initial.m
Initial2.m
Heaviside.m
Delta.m
ChanVeseImp.m
ReInitializeOrd1Damped.m

Main function: levelsetsegmentation.m
You can get the cells' segmentation outlines as:

[phi]=levelsetsegmentation('input_image.tif');

You can change the numbers in the 27th and 49th line, to look for better segmentation results.


2.Cell Tracking, including files:
full_tracking.m
cell_tracking2.m
tracking_resultsshow.m
graphmatrix.m
getcentroid_f.m
getcentroid.m
getcentralcell.m
centralcell_trackingn.m

Main function:full_tracking.m
[correspondence]=full_tracking(phi1,phi2,3,3,60,1,1);
