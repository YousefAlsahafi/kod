Our aim is to replicate an FPS player with software, so we can play
the game through a virtual player. Virtual player software will
process raw images coming from the game and send key messages to move
around, and shoot. This project's code wil not be a "bot" because
usual bots can and do make game API calls and get direct
information. Our job is harder, our software will need to process
images, run pattern recognition, calculate features, etc. in order to
"see" inside the game, just like a regular "human" player would. 

For installation, testing info see NOTES.
